# Discord Game Roles Bot

A simple bot that gives users roles according to the activity they are doing.

The idea of the bot is simple and useful, when a user starts playing a game, the bot automatically gives the user the role. Once a user stops playing a game, the role is removed.

After cloning the project and installing all dependencies, you need to add your Discord API token in the config.json file.

In app.js, there is a part that you must add the game you want to monitor, and put the role ID you created in your discord server.

```bash
"VALORANT": {
        name: "valorant",             //NAME ROLE TOLOWERCASE
        id: '735224527851618396'      //ROLE ID
 },
 ```
